# Chinook-Database

In this project, I help a music store team get a better understanding of the media in their store, their customers and employees: <br>
1) I use SQL to to query Chinook Database, the database that holds information about Chinook music store, to pull the data needed to answer some questions: <br>
 -What is the Average Music Track Length by Genre? <br>
 -What are the Top Genres in our Top 5 Countries? <br>
 -How Did Agents Fare in our Top 5 Countries with Most Sales? <br>
 -Sales and Customers Growth Over the Years in our Top 5 Countries <br>
2) I use Microsoft Excel to visualize my insights <br>
3) I provide my visuals as well as a written summary in a pdf report
